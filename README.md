# Code Conversion to Python 3
This code is taken from [Joomla! Core 1.5.0 - 3.9.4 - Directory Traversal / Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46710) and was converted to Python 3 to suit the exercise in [Academy](http://academy.hackthebox.com/) for Module "Attacking Commoon Applications" and section "Attacking Joomla".

The original code was written in Python 2, but it has been converted using the 2to3 tool. However, some additional changes were necessary to make the code compatible with Python 3.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage
To run the code, simply execute the script in a terminal or command prompt using Python 3. For example:
```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpgg101/CVE-2019-10945/main/CVE-2019-10945.py
$ python3 CVE-2019-10945.py
```
